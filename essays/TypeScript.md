So far, working with TypeScript reminds me of another programming language I had used prior to this - C#.

Most of what I have learned revolves around TypeScript's formatting.

Other than some minor formatting differences and helper classes, I can utilize some of what I have learned in C# and apply it here.

TypeScript feels like an effective front-end programming language like JavaScript foundation it runs on.  As such it works nicely in GUI and programming user-oriented applications.  It does not have the processing speed and efficiency needed to keep up with C and C++ when it comes to database processing.

Additionally I find TypeScript easier to use than JavaScript, due to featuring a far more developed IDE, although this may be due to my bias towards C#.  I still have yet to use TypeScript for larger projects anywhere near the caliber I have used C# for though.
